Installation process of Mysql
Install MySQL
Install the MySQL database server on your PC. We will do this using the 'MSI' one-click installer for Windows. Go to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ and download the 'MySQL Installer for Windows'. At the time of writing this was from a very obvious graphic at the top of the screen (which I missed the first time).
Run the installation. Click...
Install MySQL products
Accept the license
Allow the version check (optional)
At 'Choose a Setup Type' accept the "Developer Default" and click Next
A number of downloads of required software may be identified. Click Execute and follow onscreen instructions to install them.
At 'Installation progress' screen, hit Execute - the MySQL software will be installed
At 'Configuration overview' hit Next to go to the basic configuration screen.
Accept all the defaults on the 'MySQL Server Configuration' and hit Next.
On the password screen, supply a password for the 'root' (main administrator) user. Make sure it's one you won't forget. You can also create a 'User' account just for Moodle with more restricted access if you like. This would be good practice on a public server but just using the 'root' user will suffice for testing.
On the Service details page, accept the defaults and hit Next and then Next a couple more times for the configuration progress.
Click Finish. Job done.
MySQL Workbench will open. Under Server Administration (right hand column, double click 'Local MySQL56' (or whatever you called it). A box should pop up asking for the root password. Enter the password you supplied
The server management screen should appear. You don't have to worry too much about this. It just shows the install is working.
